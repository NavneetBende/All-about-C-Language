Programmers can change one data type to another by using type casting.
The program is made lighter by typecasting.
Example 2:
Run
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int x = 19, y = 2;
	char c = 'x';
	double div;
	div = (double)x / y;
	c = c + 2;
	printf("The output of Implicit typecasting : %c\n", c);
	printf("The output of Explicit typecasting: %f", div);
	return 0;
}
