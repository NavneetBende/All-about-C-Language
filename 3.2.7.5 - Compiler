Goes through the entire program and translates it as a whole in a single run.
It  takes more time to analyse the source code but the overall execution time is faster.
Generates intermediate object code which  requires linking, hence requires more memory.
It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program. Therefore debugging is relatively hard.
It generates the intermediate code.
Programming language like C, C++ use compilers.
Compiler and Interpreter both are language translators and both converts the high level language into machine code but there are some differences in between compiler and interpreter.
