Scope is defined as region or block in which a variable is declared, defined, and utilised; the variable is removed automatically when the region or block expires. It can also be remembered as lifetime of a variable

Representation of Scope :
int main() { --------1--------------------------------------------|
                                                                  |
    int a;           // scope of a                                |
                                                                  |
    func() {  -------2----------------|                           |
        int b;  //scope of b          |                           |
                                      |                           |
    } ---------------3----------------                            |
                       // scope of a                              |
    return 0;                                                     |
} ----------------4-----------------------------------------------|
In the above code , scope of variable a is from 1 to 4 space while scope of variable b is from 2 to 3 space.As variable a is declare in main() scope while variable b is declared in func() scope.

Types of variables

In the C programming language, variables can be defined in three different places.

Local variables are variables found within a function or a block.
Global variables are variables that exist outside of all functions.
Formal parameters are used in the defining of function parameters.

 Local Variables : 

Local variables are those that are defined within a function or block.Only statements included within that function or code block are permitted to use them. Outside of their own function, local variables are unknown.

Below example are representing the scope of local variables a and b.

#include<stdio.h>

int main() { -------------------------------1-----------------|
                                                              |
    int a, b;   // local variable                             
                                                              |
    a = 20;                                                   |
    b= 10;                                                    |
                                                              |
    return 0;                                                 |
}-------------------------------------------2-----------------|
