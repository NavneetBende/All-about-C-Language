Scope is defined as region or block in which a variable is declared, defined, and utilised; the variable is removed automatically when the region or block expires. It can also be remembered as lifetime of a variable

Representation of Scope :
int main() { --------1--------------------------------------------|
                                                                  |
    int a;           // scope of a                                |
                                                                  |
    func() {  -------2----------------|                           |
        int b;  //scope of b          |                           |
                                      |                           |
    } ---------------3----------------                            |
                       // scope of a                              |
    return 0;                                                     |
} ----------------4-----------------------------------------------|
In the above code , scope of variable a is from 1 to 4 space while scope of variable b is from 2 to 3 space.As variable a is declare in main() scope while variable b is declared in func() scope.

Types of variables

In the C programming language, variables can be defined in three different places.

Local variables are variables found within a function or a block.
Global variables are variables that exist outside of all functions.
Formal parameters are used in the defining of function parameters.
