Here we have used %d,%f,%lf and %c  formate inside the scanf() function to take int,float, double and character input respectively from user. when user input integer value, it stored in the testInterger variable.

Notice, that we have used &testInteger inside scanf(). It is because &testInteger gets the address of testInteger, and the value entered by the user is stored in that address.
