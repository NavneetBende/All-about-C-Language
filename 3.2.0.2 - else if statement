if you want to put another condition in the middle of if and else, then you can do this by defining else if block.

Syntax of else-if statement
if(condition)
{     
      //statement to be executed if condition is true
}
else if(condition)
{  
    //statement to be executed if else if condition is true
}
else(condition)
{
    // statement to be executed if, neither if nor else if is true.
}
