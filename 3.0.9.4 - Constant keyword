We can define a constant to a program using #define or const int or const float or const char whichever we want and that keyword (identifier) will have a fixed value and can not be changed later (remains a constant).
Example :

Run
#include<stdio.h>
#define LENGTH 10
void main()
{
       const int BREADTH=5;
       int area;
       area=LENGTH*BREADTH;
       printf("%d",area);
}
