A C Preprocessor performs processing of source code or high level language(HLL).
The first step in the language processing system is preprocessing. This language processing system converts the high level language into a language that is easily understood by the machine i.e. machine level language.
C Preprocessor working
The intermediate steps involved between writing a C program and itâ€™s execution are shown in the figure above.

A preprocessor is primarily used for performing three tasks on high level language(HLL) code given below:

Expanding macros: The preprocessor replaces occurrences of macro names with their corresponding definitions.
Including files: The preprocessor inserts the contents of specified files into the source code at the point where the #include directive appears.
Conditional compilation: The preprocessor can include or exclude parts of the source code based on specified conditions, using the #if, #ifdef, and #ifndef directives.
Replacing constants: The preprocessor replaces occurrences of constants with their corresponding values, using the #define directive.
