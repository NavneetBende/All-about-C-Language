Data types in C help programmers to work with different types of data in a program. 
Using which we can accept and print different types of data. 
These data types have a definite range of data, and we have to choose the data type according to their range and our data set. 
Every datatype has a range according to the ASCII values of the characters in C.



Range of various Data Types:

As we have discussed above that there are many different data types in C, 
and every data type has a pre-defined range of data, under which it works, 
So we need to be smart while choosing a datatype in our program, 
below is a table which represents the different data-type, and their data range.
