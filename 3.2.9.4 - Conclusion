To sum up, keywords and identifiers are basic but important parts of C programming.

Keywords are reserved words like int, if, and return that have special meanings and can’t be used for anything else.
Identifiers are the names we give to variables, functions, and other elements we create.
They must follow certain rules and can’t be the same as keywords.
Knowing the difference helps avoid errors and write clear, working programs.
If you’re learning C, start by practicing how to name things correctly and understand what each keyword does. It builds a strong base for coding ahead.
