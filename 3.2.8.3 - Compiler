A Compiler is a program that  translates source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language computer understandable language(e.g. assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program
It is more intelligent than interpreter because it goes through the entire code at once
It can tell the possible errors and limits and ranges.
But this makes it’s operating time a little slower
It is platform-dependent
It help to detect error and get displayed after reading the entire code by compiler.
In other words we can say that, “Compilers turns the high level language to binary language or machine code at only time once”, it is known as Compiler.
