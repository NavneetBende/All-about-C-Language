When character values to it then it is called a character constant.
Character constant works as a normal variable.
Character constant takes only a single character.
The character constant is also used with escape sequences.
Example :

Run
#includelt;stdio.h>
int main()
{
   const char ch = 'S';
   const char escape[] = "Hello\tWorld";
   printf("character constant is %c", ch);
   printf("string constant is %s",escape);
   return 0;
}
