Constant in C

Constant are those Whose value can not be change during program execution. 
whenever you declare the constant its value remain fixed during execution of the program.
If there is an attempt to change its value then there is an error in the progam.


About Constant :
A value or a keyword that has a definite set value is called a constant.
Value of Constant is fixed.
Constant can be any data types.
Constant is also known as Literals.
Constant is also the pointer.

Syntax :
const data_type variable_name = value(optional);

Example :


#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   const int SIDE =20;
   int Volume;
   Volume=SIDE * SIDE * SIDE;
   printf("the volume of cube with side : %d is %d cu. units", SIDE,Volume);
}

Output :

the volume of cube with side :20 is 8000 cu. units

In C language there are two types of constant:-
Constant Literals
Constant variables

Constant Literals
Constant Literals are values that you use directly in the program. for example,
y=x+2;

In this example, 2 is constant literal. It has been directly used in the program. it can not be changed during execution in the program.

Constant Variables
you declare the constant variable like variables. 
The advantage of a constant variable is that if you have to change constant later then you do not need to change it many places, 
you only change the value of constant variable so that the value is automatically changed everywhere.

Types of Constant

There are 4 types of constant in C:-
Integral Constant
Floating constant
Character constant
String constant

Let’s discuss what are these in brief.
