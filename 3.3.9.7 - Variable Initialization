When the variable is initialized, then it allocates the memory according to data type of variable.
In variable initialization, a variable takes only a value.
Here, a, b, c are variables and int, float, char are data types. We can also provide the value to the variable during it’s declaration.


Syntax for Single Variable Initialization

data_type single_variable_name = value;

Example:

int a = 18 ;
float b = 17.21 ;
char c = "A" ;
