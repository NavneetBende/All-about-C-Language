When the variable is initialized, then it allocates the memory according to data type of variable.
In variable initialization, a variable takes only a value.
Here, a, b, c are variables and int, float, char are data types. We can also provide the value to the variable during it’s declaration.


Syntax for Single Variable Initialization

data_type single_variable_name = value;

Example:

int a = 18 ;
float b = 17.21 ;
char c = "A" ;


Scope of variables

By scope of a variable we mean which part of the code a variable is accessible (visible) to .A variable can have many scopes in c let’s discuss some of them .

According to Scope, variables is divided into two categories:-

Local Variables
Global Variables

Local Variable
Local variables are those variables that are defined in a small block of the program such as function, control statement block etc. Such variables are used only by the same block.

A variable inside the function/block is a local variable .
Local Variables is inside the function.
The default value of the Local variables is ‘garbage value’.
