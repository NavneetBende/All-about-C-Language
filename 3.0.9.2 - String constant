A string constant is a string array (coming up in later lessons) having fixed string values to it.
String constant takes a single character and multiple characters.
The value of the string constant is written within the double quotation mark (“”).
a string constant is also used with escape sequences.
Example :

Run
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   const char st1[] = "S";    //string with single character
   const char st2[] = "Hey Somya";    //Normal string constant
   const char st3[] = "Hey\nSomya";      //string constant with escape sequences
   printf("string constant with single character: %s", st1);
   printf("normal string constant: %s", st2);
   printf("string with escape sequences: %s", st3);
   return 0;
}
