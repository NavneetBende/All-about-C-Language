History of C Language
To overcome the problems of languages such as B and BCPL, Dennis Ritchie from The United States of America developed C language in 1972. This page is all about history of C language.

 

History of C
Invention of C Language
C was developed by Dennis Ritchie, he was born on 9th September, 1941. Ritchie invented two great inventions, C programming language and Unix operating system.he also co-authored a book “The C Programming Language”.

C is used for creating system application.Implementation of system software was designed by C language.It is a case sensitive programming language.

Dennis Ritchie further was referred as “The Father of Modern Programming Languages”.

Introduction to C Programming

Note:
C is a simple programming language in the history of computing programming language. It is structure oriented. Nowadays, many programming languages have arrived with many features like C++, python, Java and more but C is a base of any language. 

Initially C was developed to be used in UNIX operating system, but nowadays it’s compatibility has grown a lot ranging from windows, Mac, Linux, Ubuntu and others.Many of the important working principle of C comes from BCPL, developed by Martin Richards, although B,BCLP are typeless languages C provides a number of different data types.

C Programming history:-
In 1960, ALGOL was developed by the  international group.
In 1966, Martin Richards developed BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language before developing C.
Later, Ken Thomson further developed BCPL by developing the first letter of BCPL i.e. he developed the B language.
Ken Thomson developed BASIC type of UNIX Operating System, while the B language was in motion.
After all this, by further developing the B language, Dennis Ritchie developed the C language in the Bell laboratory.  
After developing the C language, Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson together developed the UNIX Operating System.
In 1978, Kerni Ghan and Ritchie both did further improvement in C language and they brought the C programming language in front of the whole world.
In 1989, ANSI C developed by the ANSI Committee.
In 1999, The new version of C was developed, In which have new features like Data Types- char,float,int,double was used.
Today’s  we are using the new version of C is C11, which is developed by Standard Committee.
