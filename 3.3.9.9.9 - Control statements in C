Introduction to control statements
In C language we have to perform a lot of operations and to do them we have a bunch of control statements that help us to perform specific tasks. 
In C language you can decide which statements you want to execute in your program and which statements you want to skip. 
This is called decision making. 
Most decisions are done on a condition basis. When a particular condition arrives, you can execute the statements. 
Because these statements work with the conditions, they are also called conditional statements. 
And because they control execution in the statement program, they are also called control statements.

Control statement in C
C program is the group of two or more statements, which is sequentially executed. 
But sometimes programmer may need to repeat any statements many times or change the sequence of program.

           +------------------+
           |  Decision Making |
           +------------------+
              /     |     \
             /      |      \
        +----+   +--+--+   +--------+
        | if |   |if-else| | switch |
        +----+   +------+  +--------+
             \
              \
           +---------+
           | else-if |
           +---------+

If statement

An if statement is used to make a comparison between two or more set of values, 
and if that condition or comparison is satisfied then the part of the code written in the if statement will get executed.
if statement block’s is defined by curly braces{}. 
When the condition is true then the statement given in this block is executed.
If the condition is false then skip the entire block.

            -----------------

                 [ Code ]
                    |
                    v
              +---------------+
              |   Condition   |
              +---------------+
               /             \
          False               True
             |                  |
             v                  v
     [ Outside if ]   [ Inside conditional block ]

[OR]

        Code
         |
         v
     ( Condition ? )
        /      \
     False     True
      |          |
      v          v
 Outside if   Inside
              if block


Syntax of if statement

if(condition)
{
      //statements to be executed if condition is true.
}

Example:

#include
void main()
{
     int a=8;
     int b=5;        //checks if a is greater than b
     printf("a is greater than b");
}
