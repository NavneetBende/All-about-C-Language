Translates one line of a program at a time.
Time taken to analyse the source code is less but the overall execution time is slower.
No intermediate object code is generated, hence are memory efficient.
Continues translating the program until the first error is met, in which case it stops. which is why debugging is easy.
It does not generate the intermediate code.
Programming language like Python, Ruby use interpreters.
