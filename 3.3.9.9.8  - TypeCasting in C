Introduction to TypeCasting
The method of typecasting in C involves utilizing the casting operator during program design to change one data type to another.

Depending on what we want the programme to perform, type casting causes the compiler to automatically switch from one data type to another.

Syntax:
int a;
float b;
b = (float) a;

Types of TypeCasting in C:

Implicit typecasting
Explicit typecasting

Implicit Typecasting:
In C, implicit type casting is used to change any variable’s data type without changing the value it stores.
Without changing any of the values kept in the data variable, it executes the conversions.
