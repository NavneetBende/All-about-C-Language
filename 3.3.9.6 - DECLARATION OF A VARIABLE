While programming you first need to tell the computer/compiler the variable’s name and it’s data type, when you do that the compiler creates an empty memory reserved for that data .

In other words, we can say that

When we declare a variable , then it allocates memory according to the data type of variable.
After declaration of th variable, it takes Garbage Value inside it.

Syntax  for  Single Variable Declaration

data_type single_variable_name;
Example:

int a;
float b;
char c;

Source code:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   int a=25;
   printf("value of a : %d", a);
   return 0;
}
Output:

value of a : 25
