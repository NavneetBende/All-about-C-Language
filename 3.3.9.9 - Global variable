As oppose to local variable a global variable is out side every function and is accessible to all the functions and the value of a global variable can be changed by any function.

Global variables are those variable whose scope is in whole program. These variables are defined at the beginning of the program.

Global variables are out of the function.
Global variables have visibility throughout the program.
The default value of ‘Global Variables’ is ‘0’.

Example :

#include<stdio.h>
int d=20; // global variable
int main()
{
      int a,b,c; // local variables
      a = 10;
      b = 30;
      d = d + 10;
      c = a + b + d;
      printf("%d",c);
      return c;
}
On execution of the program the compiler prints 70 .
