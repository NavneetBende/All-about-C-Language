Difference between C and C++
When it comes to programming languages, C and C++ are two names that often pop up. Both languages are widely used and have made significant contributions to the world of software development.

However, they have distinct differences in terms of functionality, features, and application. In this article, we will explore the dissimilarities between C and C++, helping you make an informed choice when it comes to selecting the right language for your programming needs.

Difference Between C and C++
C++ is an enhanced version of C which has Object-oriented flavour which enhanced the developer  speed and productivity
MongoDB and Apache HTTP server had its design motivation from C++ alone
Top 10 Key differences between C and C++
Parameters	C	C++
1.	History	Dennis Ritchie from The United States of America developed C language in 1972.	C++ is introduced in the early ’80s (1982) by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT& T Bell Labs Murray Hills, NewJersey,USA.
2.	Language Type	C is a procedural programming languge.	C++ is a hybrid programming language i.e. (Procedural+OOPs).
3.	Approach	C use top-down approach.	C++ uses bottom-up approach.
4.	Keywords	C has 32 Keywords.	C++ supports 95 Keywords.
5.	Memory Allocation	C use calloc() and malloc() functions for dynamic memory allocation and free() for de-allocation.	C++ use new operator for dynamic memory allocation and delete operator for de-allocation.
6.	Object Oriented Programming Support	C do not support any kind of OOP features.	C++ is an OOP based language and support all OOPs features.
7.	Access Modifiers	C structure does not have access modifiers.	Access modifiers are used in C++ structures.
8.	Vitual and friend functions	No support for virtual and friend function in C	C++ supports virtual and friend functions.
9.	Support for error handling	No support for error handling.	try catch throw blocks help in error handling.
10.	Namespace	Does not support namespace resulting in less effecient code and name collisions.	Supports namespace to prevent name collisions.
11.	Function and Operator overloading.	C does not support function and operator overloading directly.	C++ supports function and operator overloading.
12.	Reference Variable	No support for refrdence variables.	C++ supports refrence variable.
13.	Use By	Microsoft Windows Kernel, Telegram Messenger, Oracle Database, MySQL, etc.	Google Chrome, Microsoft Office, Torque 3-D game engine, and so many more.

Program to check armstrong number or not

1: Object-Oriented Design
C++ has support for Class, object, inheritance, abstraction, etc as a result code reusability, data hiding, and memory management is possible
C doesn’t have OOPs features, data is open everywhere and move freely through functions
2: Procedural v/s Hybrid Language
C is a procedural language i.e development of code in the form of a list of  instructions (functions) where each instruction conveys the compiler to do some action
C++ is viewed as Hybrid language i.e it can be used as object-oriented or traditional C type Procedural Programming i.e using OOPS in C++ is optional whereas in java it is mandatory.
3: Namespace Feature
C has predefined function support only in the form of header files, as a result, you cannot duplicate the names within the file or program
C++ has namespace feature which enables to have same names for functions or variables which  solves naming collision problem
With namespace in C++
Run
#include<iostream>
namespace Prep1  //first namespace
{
    int a = 1;
}
namespace Prep2  //2nd namespace
{
    int a = 2; //same name but different namespace
}
int main()
{
    cout << Prep1::a;
    cout << Prep2::a;
  
    return 0;
}
Without namespace in C++
Run
#include<iostream>
int main()
{
    int a = 1;
    // int a = 2 error: a is previously used

    return 0;
}
4: Reference Variables support
Reference variables enable the user to have multiple variables point a single memory address which is not possible in C
C++ has only pointer support: When the reference variable is lost it can be accessed through another alias variable, but if the pointer is lost,  the whole security comes into question

5: Keywords
C supports 32 keywords whereas C++ has also the same 32 keywords and along with exclusive 20 keywords it has a count of 52 keywords in C++
6: Overloading of functions and operators
C++ can have  different functionalities for the same operator
ex: + can join a string and arithmetic addition of numbers (using Operator Overloading)
C++ can have the same name for different functions where the only type of input is different (using Function Overloading)
In C you have abs() labs() sabs() function here function code is the same only datatype is different but still, you need to have a different namer which  hampers readability.
7: Subset v/s Superset
C is a subset of C++ whereas C++ is a superset of C which means all the
C codes can be clubbed or run alone in C++ compiler but vice-versa not possible.
8: Support for exception handling
C++ has direct support for exception handling in the form of try, throw, catch keywords which can avoid abnormal termination of the program due to runtime errors
In C any runtime error occurs program shutdowns immediately
ex: the situation of divide by 0 can be handled in C++ but in C it results in compiler failure.
9: Designers and History
C was developed by Dennis Ritchie In 1970s at AT&T Bell Labs with the combined features  of BCPL and Basic Programming Languages
Inspired from the class feature of Simula67 and block structured
programming of C, C++was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of C.
10: When C and When C++
C is the only option for embedded systems and System level code(operating System design)
C++ gives High-end performance when used in device drivers, server-side applications, gaming, networking i.e super secure application design requires data-hiding from OOPS.
