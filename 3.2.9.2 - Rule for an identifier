An identifier can only have alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscore (_).
The first character of an identifier can also contain alphabet (a-z, A-Z).
Identifiers are also case sensitive in C. For example  name and Name are two different identifiers in C.
Keywords are not allowed to be used as identifiers.
No special character, such as semicolon, period, white spaces, slash or comma are permitted to be used in or as identifiers.
