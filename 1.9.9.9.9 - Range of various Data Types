As we have discussed above that there are many different data types in C, and every data type has a pre-defined range of data, under which it works, so we need to be smart while choosing a datatype in our program, below is a table which represents the different data-type, and their data range.

Name Of The Datatype	Range of Datatype
Double	2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308
Long Double	3.4E-4932 to 1.1E+4932

Unsigned Long	0 to 18446744073709551615
Float	.2E-38 to 3.4E+38
int	-32,768 to 32,767 or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
unsigned int	0 to 65,535 or 0 to 4,294,967,295
