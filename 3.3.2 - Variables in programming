In computer terms a variable is the name of the memory location of the data which can be accessed with the help of that name and can be rewritten or used for calculations later on. Variable is a storage area. which is used to store the data. variable data is contained, which can be changed at any time during program execution. After declaring the variable it is given a value, this value is to be assigned in the many form. Like x = 5; or a=10;    Before using the variable it is necessary to declare in C. Values of variables are changeable. You can delete a value and enter another value.  You can also do this on compile time and dynamically(during program execution). For example:  Let’s say we have to store a student’s name and his roll number in variable. For this we take two variables, store the name of the student in a variable while the other variable stores the roll number.
