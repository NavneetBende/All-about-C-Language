Local variables are those variables that are defined in a small block of the program such as function, control statement block etc. Such variables are used only by the same block.

A variable inside the function/block is a local variable .
Local Variables is inside the function.
The default value of the Local variables is ‘garbage value’.
Example :

#include<stdio.h> 
int main()
{
     int a,b,c; // local variables
     a =10;
     b = 30;
     c = a + b;
     printf("%d",c);
}
Here a, b, c all are local variables and can not be used by any other function except main. On execution of the program the compiler prints 40
