In C, each data type has a unique set of operations that can be done on it and varied memory requirements. The type of data that the variable can store, such as character, integer, float etc.

Classification of Data Types in C:

Types	Illustration
Primitive Data Type	Primitive data type are used as a most fundamental data type in programming languages. Examples of primitive data type are as byte, character, sort, int, boolean, long, float and double.
User Defined Data Type	A user defined data type is a data type that can be derived from an existing data type.Examples of user derived data types are as array, pointer, structure and union.
Void Data Type	A void data type is a data type that hasn’t any value or operator and it doesn’t give any response to its caller. A void data type comes from primitive data type.
Derived Data Type


Size of Data Types:

Data Types	Size (in bytes)
Int	4
Char	1
Float	4
long	4
Short	2
Double	8

Problem 1
Write a program to calculate the size of integer type data.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int size_of_int=sizeof(int);
	printf("The size of int data type = %d\n",size_of_int );
return 0;
}
